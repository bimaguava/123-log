### Preface

> My USB drive need to be persistence to be working with hirens boot in case repairing pc

### Requirements

* Hirens boot PE iso
* GimagesX (It will allow you to work with WIM files from the Windows installation media and create a Windows To Go drive without needing the Microsoftâ€™s official Windows-To-Go-creator tool, or the Windows AIK or ADK (Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit)
* Poweriso

### Steps

1. Extract hirens iso with **poweriso** or another program like that
2. Copy **_\\source\\boot.wim_** to media installation (USB drive) with **GimagesX**

3. Ensure USB drive partition active! I need to make the Windows To Go partition active so my computer can boot from the **USB drive (F:)**. Just run **_compmgmt.msc_** to check it.

4. Create Boot Files/Entries (UEFI and BIOS) to the USB Drive. Just run:

       F:
       cd \Windows\System32
       bcdboot.exe F:\Windows /s F: /f all

   This error indicate the F: partition (my USB drive) is not completely actived. Because My drive/disk partition is not MBR disk. The partition can be ACTIVE only for fixed MBR disk. See this error message!

   **Solved:**
5. The **\\EFI\\** directory with the boot files is created on the root of F:

   That's all.
6. Booting.
