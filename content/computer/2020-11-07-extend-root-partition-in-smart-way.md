### To the point

The thing is resize other partition and add to right (otherside root partition) partition.

But, the problem you know using Linux's WTF tools is harder than anything. Becase I lazier, don't use complicated command and I avoid risk of lost any data on my hardisk or partition.

### What's Method?

First, what is the method? It's simple

1. resize "big partition" in your hardisk to get deleted or free partitions section
2. slide the into **right side** root partition
3. after that you can resize or extend the root partition

### What's tool?

Second, whats tool?

1. aomei partition assistant pro **NO, but can be used for resize your NTFS and slide them to right side of root partition**
2. ~~acronis disk director~~ _(Not support EXT4)_
3. ~~easeus partition crack version~~ _(to long process or I don't know maybe it stuck :v)_
4. paragon partition manager **YES _(you can use this)_**

> NOTE!

Paragon actually can't resize Linux partition in this case EXT4 **if the partitions is "your Linux File System"** It means if root take the space from home partition (in case /home is your right side) Its not work.

### Let's see!
