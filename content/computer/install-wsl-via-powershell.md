## Let's start with my case

In this case, my version Windows is not same with other. In other words "lack" because of me. Maybe, I need an adjustment and more setup. So you can see what needed to install WSL and while minimizing errors happen. Sorry for my terrible english :)

Before install WSL make sure that you have:

* Enable **_Windows Subsystem for Linux_** and **_Windows Virtual Machine Platform_** on **Windows Feature**
* Make sure you have Windows Store
* Windows Update
