	There are so many things to say.
	I don't want to live in regrets.
	So I make this blog.

Hello, my name is Epsi. I'm an open source enthusiast.
I have made a ready to use, Hugo site customization.

{{< social-accounts >}}

	It's not that I need to share.
	I just want to back it up to cloud.

Although I like command line, I'm not a hacker.
You won't find any illegal activities in this site.

	I know nothing. Nothing at all.

I am a mechanical engineer.
Neither software engineer, nor financial engineer.
